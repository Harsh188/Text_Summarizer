# Text_Summarizer

This project is a part of my semester long 'mini-project' course at PES University. With the guidance of Dr. S Natarajan and the help of my fellow colleague Zayd J we were able to deploy google's state of the art abstractive text summarization model, PEGASUS, onto the internet for anyone to utilize.

## Abstract: ##

Although emerging technology and a surplus of data are resulting in ground breaking research in the field of deep learning, deploying state of the art models into products is still a challenging task. In this work, we aim to expose the difficulties in deployment and operation to help familiarize individuals to the ML pipeline by utilizing various services on the Google Cloud Platform. We have implemented a state of the art transformer model, PEGASUS, in an end-to-end abstractive text summarizer product which has been deployed onto the internet for anyone to utilize.

## Description: ##

This github repository contains 3 different branches, each of which contain a different segment of our end-to-end product. The [React_Website](https://github.com/Harsh188/Text_Summarizer/tree/React_Website) branch contains, well you can guess the code for our website which is programmed using REACT js.
